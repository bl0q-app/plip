- **Consider others**: How would this benefit the community?
- **Stay focused**: One feature per request

### ‚ùå Avoid This

- **Vague requests**: "Make it better" isn't actionable
- **Multiple features**: Keep requests focused
- **Demanding tone**: We're all volunteers here
- **Duplicate requests**: Check existing issues first
- **Implementation details**: Focus on the problem, not the solution
